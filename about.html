                    <p>
                        D London was founded by Ethiopian womenswear designer Dawit Mulat Adenager. Now
                        living and working in London, Dawit wanted to start his own brand with his
                        family back home. Influenced by his heritage and upbringing, Dawit's collections
                        focus on the combination of traditional Ethiopian fabrics with modern western
                        style. He aspires to make womenswear that can go from the office to a night out to
                        fit with the modern woman's busy lifestyle.

                        Dawit has been designing for over 25 years where he has previously worked for
                        several different designers and couture houses including Bellville Sassoon, Tom
                        Ford, Anna Valentine, and many more. Dawit currently teaches courses at London
                        College of Fashion where he has helped students to bring their own collections to
                        life for the past four years.
